## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to average commute time to work and income for my hometown of Buffalo, NY. It has always seemed that homes in the nicest suburbs are the furthest away from downtown, so I would like to get a look into some empirical data on the topic. I would look at other factors of success as well, including educational achievement. It would also be interesting to look at the racial divide between people living in the inner-city and the suburbs, and how this effects income.
